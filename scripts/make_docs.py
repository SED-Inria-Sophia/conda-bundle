# Keys in `construct.yaml` file:

This document describes each of they keys in the `construct.yaml` file,
which is the main configuration file of a conda-bundle configuration
directory.

All keys are optional, except otherwise noted.  Also, the keys `specs`
and `packages` take either a list of items, or a path to a file,
which contains one item per line (excluding lines starting with `#`).

Also note, that any line in `construct.yaml` may contain a selector at the
end, in order to allow customization for selected platforms.
